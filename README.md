# Certify

Certify is a powerful browser-based certificate generation tool that transforms data from Excel files into personalized, high-quality PDF certificates. Below you will find a feature-oriented breakdown of what Certify offers.

**Quick Start:** [Watch our tutorial video](Videos/tutorial.mkv) to see Certify in action and learn how to generate certificates in minutes.

## Key Features

### Dynamic Certificate Generation
- **Excel Integration:** Seamlessly import data from Excel files (.xlsx). Certify parses multiple sheets and rows, mapping data to certificate fields automatically.
- **Automatic Text Overlay:** Define multiple text regions on a certificate template. Each region can extract and format text dynamically based on Excel content.
- **Customizable Output:** Configure properties for each text region, including font size, font family, alignment, and text transformation (e.g., title case).

### Image Processing & Rendering
- **Template-Driven Design:** Use any certificate image as a background. Certify overlays text onto the certificate image with precise region control.
- **Offscreen Rendering:** Leverage an offscreen canvas for smooth, high-performance rendering without impacting UI responsiveness.
- **Quality Control:** Convert rendered images to JPEG at optimal quality, ensuring that PDFs retain visual fidelity and consistency.

### Web Worker Offloading
- **Efficient Processing:** Utilize a dedicated Web Worker to handle heavy tasks such as Excel parsing, image manipulation, and PDF generation.
- **UI Responsiveness:** Keep the main thread free by offloading processing tasks, allowing users to interact with the UI without lag.
- **Error Handling:** Built-in error detection ensures that issues in data parsing or image processing are handled gracefully.

### PDF & ZIP Generation
- **Personalized PDFs:** Generate a separate PDF for each certificate, embedding the certificate image along with the dynamically added text.
- **Batch Processing:** Process thousands of certificates in one go, with each certificate customized based on user data.
- **ZIP Packaging:** Automatically compile all generated PDFs into a single ZIP archive for convenient download and distribution.

### User-Centric Design
- **Intuitive Interface:** A clear and user-friendly HTML layout enables easy file uploads, region setup, and configuration of text overlays.
- **Real-Time Preview:** Adjust text regions on the certificate image and preview how the final output will look before generating certificates.
- **Accessibility:** Developed with modern web standards ensuring compatibility with modern browsers and various devices.

## How It Works

1. **File Upload & Region Definition:**
   - Drag and drop or select your certificate image and Excel file.
   - Define text regions on the image where data will be placed. Configure each regionâ€™s appearance (font, size, text case).

2. **Background Processing:**
   - The Web Worker parses the Excel file, reading data row by row.
   - For each row, the certificate image is rendered with specific text overlays according to the defined regions.
   - The composite image is converted to a JPEG and embedded into a PDF using jsPDF.

3. **PDF & ZIP Output:**
   - Each personalized certificate is saved as a PDF.
   - All PDFs are then packaged into a ZIP file, which is automatically delivered to the user once processing is complete.

## Installation & Requirements

- **Modern Browser:** Requires a modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge) that supports Web Workers, OffscreenCanvas, and HTML5 File APIs.
- **No Server Required:** The entire process runs client-side, ensuring data privacy and reducing server load.
- **External Libraries:**
  - XLSX for Excel parsing
  - JSZip for ZIP archive creation
  - jsPDF for PDF generation
